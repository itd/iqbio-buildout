Installation Notes
======================

* This buildout requires a ``buildout-cache`` directory at the same
  level as the iqbio-buildout.  So, while in the iobio-buildout dir,
  type:

      mkdir ../buildout-cache/{eggs,downloads}

* Remember to change the effective-user to match your production
  or development environment user.
